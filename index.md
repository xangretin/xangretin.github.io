# Hi, I'm Xander

Aspiring security professional and developer, I am hoping to build my knowledgebase from the ground up. I will be documenting my journey here as I learn about various topics related to networks, security, and development.

## About Me

I am currently working in IT and building my skills from the fundamentals. I havea beginners knowledge in the following, through either certification, self study, or just playing around with a new system:

- Python scripting and tooling
- Linux administration
- Networking fundamentals
- Homelabbing
- Hardware troubleshooting
- Virtualization

I have been fascinated with the world of cybersecurity since I was in middle school watching a youtuber explore the deep web, removing some of the dark mystery surrounding it.
The goal is to use this as a platform to keep myself consistent, and document my journey as I learn more and more, as well as a central repository for my projects.
